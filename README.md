## ðŸš€ Recently Launched Commercial Projects

**AI Voice Applications**

* **[YOVO AI](https://yovo.ai/main)** â€“ Next.js (frontend) + Rust (backend)
  An innovative application that seamlessly integrates STT, LLM, and TTS technologies to transform the high school counseling experience. Each year during the college entrance exam season, our team consistently rolls out new features to better support students and educators.

* **[IELTS Buddy](https://ielts-buddy-hui.netlify.app/)** â€“ Next.js (frontend) + Rust (backend)
  A real-time voice dialogue system powered by WebSocket. Built entirely in Rust on the backend, it integrates speech recognition, large language models, and speech synthesis to deliver a smooth English speaking practice experience with session persistence and reconnection capabilities.

> ðŸ’¡ I've independently deployed a custom TTS (text-to-speech) service optimized for low latency and natural-sounding voices. This service is now in commercial use and will power several of my upcoming applications.

All of these products are now in commercial production.
